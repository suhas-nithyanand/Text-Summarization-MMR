Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish 
former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday 
in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning 
over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. Many Israeli political observers believe 
that Netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this 
appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace 
agreement.
