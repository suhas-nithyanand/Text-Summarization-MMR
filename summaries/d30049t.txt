President 
Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged 
that his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. 
endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at 
a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop 
missiles. Directing his remarks at 
North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal 
that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement 
touted by Kim as a sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean 
War enemy. American 
officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands 
of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, 
the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled 
enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. ``I ask the North Koreans to think about this,'' he 
said, arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented 
them with a great opportunity.
