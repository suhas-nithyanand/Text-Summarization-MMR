As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the 
Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night,

outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound

World Series games and is content watching his teammates play the 
Padres on television.
