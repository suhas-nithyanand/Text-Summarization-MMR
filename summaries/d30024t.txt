That's what the message of 
the election was.'' The question, as it always is with Gingrich, 
is how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership. Rep. Michael 
P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who had marginalized 
the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism. Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, 
but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce 
his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, after he had determined 
if he could win. Not only that, but 
Carville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the 
Republicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leaders in his 
own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before 
Election Day.
