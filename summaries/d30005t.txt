Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. Fawwaz, who served as an informal 
press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities 
in September after the embassy bombings.
