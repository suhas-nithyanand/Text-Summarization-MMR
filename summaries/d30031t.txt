Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first 
piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control 
module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. ``Amen,'' replied 
a launch controller. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never 
before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, 
a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on 
Nov. 20. That brevity was a result of Endeavour's having to 
rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last 
month. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be 
connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking 
astronauts to manually fit them together.
