Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of 
supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo 
an independent nation. The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting 
with Milosevic. Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations 
continued unabated. Yugoslavia had repeatedly 
rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the 
organization is restored.
