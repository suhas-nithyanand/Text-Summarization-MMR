His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced 
to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days 
after his trial. ``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no 
true commitment to international human rights standards,'' said Xiao 
Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that 
Liu Qing heads. Xu is the third leading member 
of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion 
in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested 
or interrogated. He served in the navy for five years, then became an 
electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with 
the democracy movement and going to prison. After 
a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 
the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 
12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 
years for ``subversion of state power.''
