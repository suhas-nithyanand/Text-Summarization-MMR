A Communist lawmaker also called for ``an urgent medical 
check ... on the Russian president's health'' to determine whether 
he is fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness 
would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president 
would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week. But Luzhkov has always been supportive 
of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health 
or ability to govern. But 
the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page editorial Tuesday 
that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering from something worse 
than a cold. APW19981016.0209
