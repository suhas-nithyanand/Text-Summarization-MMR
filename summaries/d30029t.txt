Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart 
race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts 
missing. Two more 
crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a second liferaft 
late Monday night, but three others who had been aboard the liferaft 
were still missing.
