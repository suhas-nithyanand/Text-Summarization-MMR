Libya has been under 
U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects. Annan's 
meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news agency, 
JANA, initially reported that Annan might not be able to meet with 
the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.'' Libyan media have suggested 
that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to 
hand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approved 
by the Congress. In Washington, James 
Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United States is awaiting 
a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied 
with U.N. Security Council resolutions. APW19981205.0213
