Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from 
Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political 
crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. Lahoud, 62, a former commander 
of Lebanon's army, was propelled to power with widespread popular 
backing. The decree was to be issued after the president 
polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime 
minister. He 
has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded 
Hrawi on Tuesday. Many hope he will 
copy his success with the military in government, which is plagued 
by nepotism and waste of public funds.
