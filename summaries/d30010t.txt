The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that 
it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, 
which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight. We did not expect this from him.'' The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel 
of failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the 
attack, because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, 
and had recently served time in Israeli jails. Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been 
sweeping enough. ``There 
was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border 
policeman who was patrolling the market and was lightly injured.
