Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his 
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had 
differed with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession. Rafidah said there have only been 
a few demonstrations in Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them 
``orchestrated.'' In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised 
and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international 
attention to his case. Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. Habibie said Anwar's 
dismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been 
proven.''
