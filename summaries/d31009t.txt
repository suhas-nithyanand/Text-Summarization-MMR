``It is wrong to see this government as simply an election 
government,'' he said. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet 
over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed 
in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the 
Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party 
whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said 
he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number 
of Cabinet seats that reflected its standing as the largest party 
in parliament.
