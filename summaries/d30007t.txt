``Our soldiers are in the town 
and the fighting is continuing,'' rebel battalion commander Arthur 
Mulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu. On Saturday, the rebels 
said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to 
land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. APW19981004.0851

After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered 
Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the 
government to halt their advances. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda 
_ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month 
rebellion _ of sponsoring the rebels. After trekking several 
hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands 
of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, 
where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base 
as a launching pad for offensives.
