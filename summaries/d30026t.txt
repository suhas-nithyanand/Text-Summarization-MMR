This new software, which now will be 
combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available 
for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. ``America Online has really changed from a closed 
online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology 
company with a diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said. In exchange for that, Microsoft 
places an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98. Though known as a new-media company 
for consumers, AOL is also interested in boosting its electronic commerce 
business with the Netscape purchase. At the same 
time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker 
once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance 
of the personal computer software market.
