Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the 
blaze started with about 400 people inside. ``Goteborg is today 
a city in shock.'' ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman 
Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and 
other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal 
fire,'' he said. The building had just two exits, 
one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg 
was quoted as saying by TT.
