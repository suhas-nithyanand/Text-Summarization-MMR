If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three 
major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching 
for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's 
recent record on gay issues to be quite strong. ``I see it as basic 
sleaze,'' he said. And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation 
as a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. ``Senator D'Amato claims he does not want to share his 
opinion with the people of New York,'' Morris said.
