It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at 
the airport. Palestinian officials 
said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were 
aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli 
security checks. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza 
and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations 
on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing. For the time being, 
it will still be a bit of an adventure to fly out of Gaza International 
or to land there. Israel retains security 
control over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport, and Palestinian 
security officials consult with their Israeli counterparts.
