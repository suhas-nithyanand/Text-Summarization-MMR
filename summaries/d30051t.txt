The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, 
a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb 
captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged 
with the massacre of the Delijajs. The tribunal, set up by the Security 
Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial 
_ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years 
for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. ``More important is that acts commited by some 
weren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army. APW19981130.0803

To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of 
genocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims 
before his morning coffee.''
