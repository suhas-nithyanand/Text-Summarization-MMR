Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to subvert 
the government,'' a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences 
of three years to life. China signed the International Covenant 
of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's 
arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment 
to its tenets. Underscoring the 
warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon 
and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,'' Zha 
said. Since dissidents began organizing and 
trying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have 
harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until 
now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations. By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, 
the ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination 
to crush challenges to its monopoly on power.
