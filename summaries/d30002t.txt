That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day. Caught 
near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000. ``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained. Honduran officials said 14 
people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had 
died elsewhere in the country.
