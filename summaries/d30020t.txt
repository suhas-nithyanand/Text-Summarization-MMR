Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian 
Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official 
said Saturday. ``But regardless, 
we should not mix sports with politics.'' They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that 
they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary 
Commission for the games. Indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at 
10 p.m. before bedtime at the Asian Games village.
