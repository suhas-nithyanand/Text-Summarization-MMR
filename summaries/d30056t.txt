Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny 
that the bodies of four men had been recovered. The severed heads of the hostages 
_ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found Tuesday. Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against 
Russia ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the

mostly motivated by ransom. APW19981209.0688

The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign 
hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's 
foreign minister. The heads were identified as those of the four abducted 
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to 
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in 
Grozny.
