But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with 
the center-left majority that elected him in 1996. The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing 
its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his 
deficit-cutting 1999 budget. On Friday, he told journalists 
that he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return 
the right to power. Passage 
of the budget, he said, is essential ``to avoid disaster.'' Officials in the 
prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet on 
Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political 
turbulence, though not to offer his resignation.
