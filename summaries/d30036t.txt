Nitric oxide is also being 
studied for its role in smell and memory. ``I have 
not come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago, an atheist, 
at the time. In its citation, 
the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that 
``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually 
enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be 
announced this year. In his early reseach years, Murad worked on a chemical 
known as cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to 
be critical in the nitric oxide story.
