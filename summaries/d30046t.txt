House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of 
shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday 
night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican 
colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past. In Clinton's case, he said, the House was 
dealing with ``a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement 
officer.'' Impeach! He quoted More's words as 
an admonition for today: ``What you have hunted me for is not my actions 
but for the thoughts of my heart. He 
said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired 
an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees 
of the FBI and the CIA.
