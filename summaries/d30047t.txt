It will fly alone for two weeks before a 
rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to 
be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. Previously, space officials have said the station would 
be jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space 
agency NASA taking a lead role. ``That's terrific.'' Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called 
down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian 
flight controllers had feared. Built by 
a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, 
the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded 
component of the station.
