Bin Laden, believed 
to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a 
U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are 
accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. It has been identified by its chassis, all that remains. ``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said. ``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said. Government officials immediately 
announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for 
information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another 
man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's 
chief military commander.
