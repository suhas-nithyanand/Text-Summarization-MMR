``After we agreed 
to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled 
on the Windows desktop,'' Case said. The next year the Justice Department formally charged 
Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows 
to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to 
buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, 
the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof 
that Microsoft was a monopolist.'' ``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the 
May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case. Microsoft, according to the people 
questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 
to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune 
Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run 
better on Windows.
