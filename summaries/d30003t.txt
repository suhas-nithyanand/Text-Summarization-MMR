The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest. ``It is only for Chilean courts 
to try events that occurred in Chile.'' Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism. APW19981021.0557

The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``All we ask is that Spain stops 
meddling in our internal affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean 
problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts.
