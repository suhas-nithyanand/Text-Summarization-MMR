IMF officials 
have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound 
economic program before the loan is given, and have made it clear 
that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles 
are not acceptable. ``Not this year.'' But, he said, the government would take 
steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia. Now it is under attack 
from all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by 
misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in 
some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia, 
to Moscow. His aim appears to 
be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund's fault 
if Russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures 
at home.
