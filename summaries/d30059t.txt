A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next 
elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. ``It will take time,'' he said, but added that investigators 
``have tips, they have something to work on.'' Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called 
on all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes 
at 8 p.m. Tuesday. She was divorced and had one 
son, according to Who's Who in Russia.
