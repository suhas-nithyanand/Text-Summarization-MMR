Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a 
second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held 
hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, 
a prosecutor said. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan 
Workers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in 
southeastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest 
was announced Friday.
