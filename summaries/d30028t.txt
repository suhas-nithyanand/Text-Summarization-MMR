Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed 
Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. Since the Syrian-Turkish crisis began, Israeli defense 
minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said Israel is not a party to it and 
that the Israeli-Turkish military coooperation is not directed against 
any third state. Egypt already has 
launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation 
over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.
