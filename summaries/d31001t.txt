An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said 
he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in 
advance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross 
human rights violations.'' Madikizela-Mandela 
has not sought amnesty. No commission 
can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was. But the 
Truth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South 
Africa is the better for it. APW19981031.0742

Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds 
with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South 
Africa.
