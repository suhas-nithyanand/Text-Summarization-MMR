On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult 
for me.'' Anwar's sensational trial 
is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled 
from politics. Critics said it was predictable 
that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. But he fired his protege from 
his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds 
he was morally unfit to lead. If Habibie passes 
up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving 
the country while there is no vice president, while there are so many 
problems to deal with.''
