Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day 
visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that 
he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated 
by the Wye River peace accord. Netanyahu 
said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National 
Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, 
said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots 
with a ``firm hand.'' On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza 
Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit.
